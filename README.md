ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Juanfer and I am interested in Machine Learning, Data Analytics and Business Growth. Here you could find several implementation attempts of state-of-the-art studies with the aim of replicating or improving the authors' results. The code is executed in python making use of frameworks such as Pytorch, Matplotlib, Numpy, DGL, among others.

Areas within Machine Learning explored in the current repositories are:

- Graph Analytics
- Deep Learning
- Image classification

Keep an eye on new uploads!
Exercises of SQL and business analytics are already in the pipeline.
